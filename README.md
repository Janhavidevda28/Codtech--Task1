Overview of the Project

Project: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) On Iris

Objective: The goal of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is to gain insights into a dataset by exploring its characteristics, structure, and relationships between variables. This process helps to identify patterns, outliers, missing data, and key trends, which are crucial for building effective machine learning models later on.

Steps of EDA:
Data Inspection:

Understand the Structure: Start by inspecting the dataset to understand its dimensions (number of rows and columns), types of variables (numeric, categorical), and how the data is organized.
Missing Values: Check for missing or incomplete data, as missing values can skew analysis and model performance if not handled correctly.
Descriptive Statistics:

Summary Statistics: Calculate basic statistics like mean, median, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, and percentiles for numerical features. This helps to understand the central tendency and variability in the data.
Target Variable: If thereâ€™s a target variable (like fraud detection or classification), analyze its distribution to understand its balance (e.g., how many fraud vs. non-fraud cases).
Univariate Analysis:

Feature Distribution: Study how each individual feature (column) is distributed. This helps detect skewness (if the data is unevenly spread) and outliers (extreme values that deviate from the normal pattern).
Visualization: Use visual tools like histograms and box plots to visualize the distribution of each feature.
Bivariate Analysis:

Relationships Between Variables: Investigate how different features relate to each other, especially with respect to the target variable. For example, how a feature like "transaction amount" varies between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
Visual Exploration: Scatter plots or pair plots are useful for identifying trends, clusters, or correlations between two or more variables.
Correlation Analysis:

Finding Relationships: For numerical data, calculate correlations to identify relationships between variables. For example, if two variables are highly correlated, it may indicate that one is redundant or can be combined with the other.
Visualization with Heatmaps: Use a heatmap to visually display the correlation matrix, which makes it easier to see which variables have strong or weak relationships.
Outlier Detection:

Identifying Outliers: Outliers are data points that deviate significantly from the rest of the dataset. These may represent unusual events (e.g., extremely large transactions) and can affect the performance of machine learning models.
Box Plots for Outliers: Visualizing data with box plots helps in detecting outliers and understanding the spread of the data.
Key Outcomes of EDA:
Understanding Data Quality: Identifying missing values or inconsistencies that need to be handled.
Discovering Patterns: Detecting trends and patterns in the data that can inform feature engineering or model selection.
Spotting Outliers: Pinpointing extreme values that could distort the analysis or model performance.
Variable Relationships: Finding relationships between variables (like correlations) which can guide feature selection or removal.
Feature Distributions: Understanding how individual features are distributed helps in applying the right data transformations (e.g., normalization or scaling).
